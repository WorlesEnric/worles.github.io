Despite there are a lot of ways to build a blog site, I utilized the jeckll academic theme and github pages to reduce the efforts. Find the commands and installation guides below:

## Installation

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/jekyll-academic.git
```

```shell
$ bundle install
```

## Building

```shell
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```

Use `--verbose` if you would like a detailed log.

## Serving
```shell
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --incremental
```
